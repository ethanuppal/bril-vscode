# Bril extension for VSCode

## Setup

**Important**: Install the Bril LSP before using this extension:

```
cargo install --locked --git https://gitlab.com/ethanuppal/cs6120 bril-lsp
```

Once you've installed it, disable and reenable this extension.

## LSP Crashes

If there's an LSP crash, let me know immediately via a GitHub issue or some
other method. See if restarting the extension fixes the problem.

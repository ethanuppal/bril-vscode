# Bril extension for VSCode

## IMPORTANT Setup

Install the Bril LSP before using this extension.
First, [install a Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) and then run:

```
cargo install --locked --git https://gitlab.com/ethanuppal/cs6120 bril-lsp
```

Once you've installed it, disable and reenable this extension if you already
installed the extension.

## LSP Crashes

If there's an LSP crash, let me know immediately via a GitHub issue or some
other method. See if restarting the extension fixes the problem.
